This is a example code for a blog <link> and yet a small utility app to help you to upload/deploy a 3rd part jar in your nexus repository. User will need to enter appearing fields for parameter like groupId, artifactId etc and the app will give out a command for mvn deploy:deploy-file which can copied/paste on console to upload the 3rd party jar.
